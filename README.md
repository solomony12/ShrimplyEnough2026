## 🕵️ Gameplay Mechanics

### 🔍 Scanner System

Players use a scanner to analyze objects and search for evidence. The scanner displays:

* Element compounds
* Amounts and percentages

Initially, scans show normal substances (like blood), but over time the compounds become stranger and more unexplainable.

Players must use a guide to interpret scan results. As they progress, they find notes that reveal what the strange compounds actually are.

### 🚪 Door Scanning

Players must scan door knobs to determine which doors lead forward:

* **Anomalous readings** = correct path
* **Normal readings** = dead ends or unimportant rooms

## 🧠 Lore

A group discovered a mysterious pit containing shrimp-like creatures. These creatures taste like shrimp, but are not shrimp. A cult formed around them, harvesting and selling the creatures.

The product is a **parasite-like shrimp**, and consuming it makes people more susceptible to brainwashing. The cult uses this to manipulate society.
