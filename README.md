## 👻 Horror Elements

* **Steam jump scares**
* **Pipes breaking off**
* **Shrimp jump scares**
* **Random eerie noises**
* **Dark, atmospheric lighting**
* **Baked lighting + dynamic lighting**

## 🕵️ Gameplay Mechanics

### 🔍 Scanner System

Players use a scanner to analyze objects and search for evidence. The scanner displays:

* Element compounds
* Amounts and percentages

Initially, scans show normal substances (like blood), but over time the compounds become stranger and more unexplainable.

Players must use a guide to interpret scan results. As they progress, they find notes that reveal what the strange compounds actually are.

### 🚪 Door Scanning

Players must scan door knobs to determine which doors lead forward:

* **Anomalous readings** = correct path
* **Normal readings** = dead ends or unimportant rooms

## 🧩 Endings

### 🩸 Ending 1 (Main Ending - Evidence Collected)

If enough evidence is gathered:

* A cult member catches the player.
* A chase occurs.
* The player falls into a hallway surrounded by cult members.
* A massive dark water tank appears.
* The **Shrimp Cthulhu entity** emerges and eats the player.
* **New ending variation:**
  The player sees a dark pit with a distant light—then the shrimp appears in a jump scare and the screen cuts to black.

### 🧾 Ending 2 (Normal Ending - No Evidence)

If not enough evidence is found:

* The player leaves the factory.
* No conviction is possible.
* Everything seems normal, and the truth remains hidden.

### ⚖️ Ending 3 (Choice Ending)

If enough evidence is collected:

* The player can choose to leave or continue.
* If they continue, the main ending occurs (curiosity kills the cat).

## 🧠 Lore

A group discovered a mysterious pit containing shrimp-like creatures. These creatures taste like shrimp, but are not shrimp. A cult formed around them, harvesting and selling the creatures.

The product is a **parasite-like shrimp**, and consuming it makes people more susceptible to brainwashing. The cult uses this to manipulate society.
